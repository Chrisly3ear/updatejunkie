[General]

# The runmode is the type of service you want to run. The default setting is 
# 'auto' in which Willhaben tries to establish a local runmode with local 
# notifications based on the platform it runs on. To use Willhaben as a 
# webservice or a daemon you need to run it in runmode 'server'. You can also 
# force a local notification system by using one of the supported runmode 
# options: 'gtk', 'osx', 'server'
runmode = auto

# Copy the URL of the willhaben.at listing you want to observe
url = http://www.example.com/

# If this option is 'no' the observer will forget all seen ads after closing
